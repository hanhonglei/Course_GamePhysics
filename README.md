# Game Physics
Concentrate on how to do physics simulation in digital games, and use physics to implement game design ideas.

[NVIDIA PhysX](https://developer.nvidia.com/physx-sdk) will be used as an example.

You have to register through [Github](http://www.github.com/) to access the PhysX repository. Please follow the instruction [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/physx-source-github).

## Other competitor physics engines
1. [HAVOK® PHYSICS](https://www.havok.com/physics/)
1. [Bullet](http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/)
1. [Matter.js](http://brm.io/matter-js/)
1. [Box2D](https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D)


## Some resources

All samples have been compiled successfully using [Visual Studio 2015]( https://www.visualstudio.com) which is vc14win32.

If you want to use Visual Studio 2017, you have to install 2015 component as well. Because there is not fully support for 2017. So first install VC++ 2015 v140 using VS 2017 installer. Then open solution in the compiler folder vc14 instead of vc15.
